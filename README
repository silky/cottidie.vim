This plugin brings friendly, syntax-highlighted Vim tips to your messages area. At 78 characters these have enough substance to inspire but not enough to distract. Try it out:

:CottidieTip

The location of the tips file is configurable, so this plugin may also serve you as a "daily tip" engine which draws from your own notes. (Not actually daily though, it doesn't include any timing mechanism.)

The target audience is intermediate level. Contributions are welcome!
